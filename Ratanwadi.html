                        <h2>Ratangad Fort</h2>
                        <p> Hike up the rugged terrain to reach the majestic Ratangad Fort, perched atop a 2600-foot
                            plateau. Witness panoramic vistas of the surrounding valleys and soak in the rich history
                            etched
                            in its remnants.</p>
                        <p> The trek to Ratangad is a moderate challenge, offering stunning views of the surrounding
                            valleys
                            and lush greenery. Climbers can choose between several routes, each with its own unique
                            charm.
                        </p>
                        <p> The fort's name has two interpretations: one claims it comes from Ratnabai Tandal, one of
                            three
                            sisters with forts named after them, while the other associates it with "Ratna", meaning
                            "jewel", reflecting its majestic presence.
                            Believed to be around 400 years old, it witnessed the Maratha reign under Chhatrapati
                            Shivaji
                            Maharaj and played a strategic role in defending the Konkan region.</p>

                        <p>Embark on a nature trail through the verdant expanse of Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary.
                            Home

                            sanctuary promises an unforgettable encounter with nature's wonders.</p>
                        <p>The highlight of the sanctuary is the majestic Kalsubai Peak, the highest point in the
                            Western
                            Ghats of Maharashtra, standing at 5646 feet. Witnessing the panoramic views from its summit
                            is
                            an unforgettable experience.</p>
                        <p>The sanctuary is home to a rich assemblage of mammals, including leopards, jungle cats, palm
                            civets, barking deer, and even the elusive Indian giant squirrels.
                            Reptiles like monitor lizards, fan-throated lizards, and various snakes add to the
                            ecological
                            diversity.

                        <h2>Umbrella Falls</h2>
                        <p>Hike through the lush trails amidst the Sahyadri ranges to reach the hidden gem - Umbrella
                            Falls.
                            The cascading water gushing over moss-covered rocks creates a picture-perfect natural
                            shower,
                            perfect for a refreshing dip.</p>
                        <p>Unlike most waterfalls, Umbrella Falls forms only during the monsoon season. As water
                            overflows
                            from the majestic Wilson Dam, it rushes through a small opening near its northern end,
                            hitting a
                            circular rock formation.
                            This unique combination creates a cascading curtain of water that gracefully folds over the
                            rock, resembling an open umbrella â€“ hence the name.</p>
                        <p>The Wilson Dam itself is a significant landmark, constructed in 1910 as a major irrigation
                            project.</p>
